# MLE estimation of the disequilibrium model of Maddala &amp; Nelson (1974)

The code was written by PÃ©ter Lang and Martin Stancsics for a one-off project.
It is provided as is, without much in the way of documentation or error handling.
Nevertheless, it should be possible to use the code as a starting point for other implementations of the disequilibrium model.

Contents:
 - The file `diseq_maxim.R` contains the functions for the MLE estimation of the disequilibrium model. In a perfect world, this would be a package with nice documentation.
 - The folder `examples` contains example applications of the code to simulated data.
 - The folder `application` contains the data used in the examples.
